    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Gołąbki is the Polish name of a dish popular in cuisines of Central Europe, made from boiled cabbage leaves wrapped around a filling of minced pork or beef, chopped onions, and rice and/or kasza.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 heads cabbage, cored</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li>
        <li>2 onions, diced</li>
        <li>4 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans chicken with rice soup</li>
        <li>2 cups rice</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can golden mushroom soup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil cabbages until leaves are falling off. Remove leaves from water as they peel off and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt margarine in a large skillet. Cook onions in margarine until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix cooked onions, ground beef, chicken with rice soup, rice, eggs, marjoram, salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Take a cabbage leaf, lay it flat, and trim the thickest part toward the bottom of leaf to make it easier to roll; repeat with all leaves. Take darker outside leaves and line the bottom of the roasting pan with them.</li>
        <li>Scoop a portion of beef meat mixture into a leaf and wrap leaf around mixture, enveloping meat completely. Repeat until all of beef mixture is used. Arrange stuffed cabbage leaves into the roasting pan. Top with any remaining cabbage leaves. Cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 45 minutes. Remove aluminum foil, peel back top layer of extra cabbage leaves, and pour golden mushroom soup over stuffed cabbage leaves. Replace top cabbage leaves, return roasting pan to oven, and continue baking until soup is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
